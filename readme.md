# Jai bindings for the International Components for Unicode library (ICU4C)

I’ve created these bindings on macOS because I needed to convert times between timezones. They are using icu4c v73.2.

I haven’t yet tested them on Linux and have made zero effort to prepare them for Windows.

## Usage

See [example/example.jai](./example/example.jai) for how to convert between timezones. I haven’t yet used the library or these bindings for anything else.
